The scripts in this directory convert Tim Buckwalter's original Arabic morphological analyzer to a finite-state representation, which can then be used for parsing.  The original Buckwalter files which are used for the build are in the directory "./original"
 
The scripts require foma to compile. The flookup program is also needed to parse words.

TO COMPILE

In this directory run "make".  This requires that perl and foma are installed. This produces two transducers in foma format in the file buckwalter-num.foma.

TO PARSE

Run:

   flookup buckwalter-num.foma

This reads from stdin and prints to stdout. This method gives the full parse (classes and glosses).  If you only want to parse a single word, you can, for example, do:

   echo "ktb" | flookup buckwalter-num.foma

If you are only interested in knowing the line numbers of the decomposed entries from the original Buckwalter files, run flookup with the -a flag:

   flookup -a buckwalter-num.foma
